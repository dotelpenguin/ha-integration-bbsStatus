            "StarDoc 134 Node #2 Waiting For Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #3 Waiting for Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #4 Waiting for Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #5 Waiting for Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #6 Waiting for Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #7 Waiting for Call",
            "StarDoc 134 Node #8 Waiting for Call",

            "StarDoc 134 Node #11 Waiting for Call"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Entities

The integration creates a sensor entity with the following attributes:

- **State**: Overall status (All Available, X/Y Used, All Busy)
- **num_instances**: Total number of instances
- **used_instances**: Number of currently used instances
- **available_instances**: Number of available instances
- **lines**: Array of status lines from the BBS

## Icons

- ðŸŸ¢ Green circle: All instances available
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow circle: Some instances in use
- ðŸ”´ Red circle: All instances busy

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
